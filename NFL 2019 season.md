![column_population](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/101d2198-5f27-4074-8219-e7b3a984de4a)

In accordance with this graph, we have created this in regards to the data we have accumulated based on the 2019 season of the NFL. This shows all the useful data gathered that we can use for our model. As seen on the graph, some of the data points are not as full as others but will still be kept in order to be able to successfully submit enough data for our model to perform correctly.

## Population of each column in file, color coded based on data types of the column

This graph is the exact same information as the graph above, but we have color coded it in order to show what data type each field in our data is used as. This will allow us to be better able to differenciate what we may have to do with each field. 

## Quarterback playes color coded by Passing or rushing. 
![pass_rush_chart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9098fa0-be17-44ba-a1bb-fec0f12a91e2)

For the purposes of this graph, the intent was to visualize the number of plays made by each quarterback during the 2019 season of the NFL.
As can be seen the data is color coated to better show which portion of the number of plays made by a specifc player fall into the rushing or passing column.


## Ratio between the passing and rushing for a single player
![pass_rush_ratio_single_player](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a184989-3dbc-4bcb-9cb9-2881171b2633)

This pie chart shows the correlation percentage for one player and how many times they either were a passer or a rusher. We built this to allow any player in the 2019 season to be added so you could see any person's correlation for their part during the season. 

## AVG passing and AVG rushing amongst all players
![whole_avg_pass_avg_rush_ratio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58d8c5cf-890f-41a1-9c34-14224e05ec03)

The pie chart referenced above, shows the average for all players passing plays compared to their rushing plays. During the 2019 season there was a large gap between the passing plays and rushing plays. 

## Touchdown to interception ratios for each player color coded to match their team color
![td_int_ratios_colored_sized](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfdeba6b-cd0f-48ed-a9bb-e32eaf208b2a)

This bar graph shows each quarterback in the 2019 season and their touchdown to interception ratio. As we can see it does go in order from largest to lowest ratio of touchdowns to interceptions. As we reach the bottom, we can see that there are a few players that have a 0 ratio. This occurred because the ratio for either touchdown or interception happened 0 times. 


## Normalized quarterback playes color coded by Passing or rushing. 
![pass_rush_chart_normalized](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d7cae67-c044-411c-8cfe-7219e7b06f1f)

This graph breaks down how much each quarterback passes versus runs, with blue for passing plays and orange for rushing plays. You can see that most QBs throw way more than they run, but some mix in a decent amount of rushing. A few guys stand out with a lot more orange, showing they rely on their legs more. This makes it easy to spot which QBs are more balanced or lean heavily on passing.

## distribution of pass and rush plays as a whole
![pass_rush_play_distribution](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1f764e1-e092-424c-b14e-1a36c0b1ebe6)

This graph shows the overall distribution of passing and rushing plays among QBs. Most players have a low number of total plays, with rushing plays shown in orange concentrated at the left end, while passing plays in blue extend farther. This suggests that only a few QBs accumulate a high volume of plays, and most rely more on passing than rushing. The steep drop-off in the number of players as total plays increase highlights how only a handful of QBs handle a bigger workload.

## Distribution of pass and rush plays as a whole with a differnt look
![different_looking_distribution](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01a701f7-f8ec-4588-b710-1972a1d19a85)

This graph shows the distribution of total plays for quarterbacks but with a different look. The colors separate different ranges of plays, showing that most quarterbacks have a low number of total plays shown in blue, while fewer QBs accumulate higher play counts shown in both red and green. The green section highlights quarterbacks with heavier workloads, emphasizing the gap between occasional players and those leading their teams.

## Scatter to show the individual pass plays vs all plays for each player
![pass_vs_total_plays_scatter_for_all](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c740c2bb-f195-4fe6-b120-cac6db93032f)

This scatter plot compares the number of pass plays to the total plays for each quarterback. Most points follow a diagonal trend, showing that the majority of total plays are passing plays, with some exceptions where QBs incorporate more rushing. The quarterbacks with the highest total plays, like Brady and Wilson, are listed at the top right, while those with fewer plays are clustered near the bottom left. This makes it easy to see which QBs are the most active and how much they rely on passing.

## Scatter to show the individual rush plays vs all plays for each player
![rush_vs_total_plays_scatter_for_all](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0f38663-86a6-46a4-8796-2fc787769b08)

This scatter plot compares rushing touchdowns to total plays for each quarterback. Most players are near the bottom, indicating that many QBs have little to no rushing touchdowns. This highlights which quarterbacks are more effective at scoring on the ground versus those who rely mostly on passing or other offensive plays.

## Overall pass plays vs total plays for single player
![passplays_vs_totalplays](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7c64824-5aed-439d-86c5-280b12cc8062)

This graph shows how many times Matt Ryan threw the ball compared to his total plays. As shown the smooth straight line means he was passing consistently. As you can see the line keeps climbing steadily, this shows that almost all of his plays were passes and confirms what we already know that Ryan does not do a lot of passes. 

## Overall rush plays vs total plays for single player
![rushplays_vs_totalplays](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a031520-2c1f-4494-adf8-36aedc5e23bb)


This graph shows how many times Matt Ryan ran the ball compared to his total plays. The steps mean his rushes happened here and there, not consistently. With only about 35 rushes in over 700 plays, it’s clear he’s mostly a passer. You can see when he decided to take off and run throughout the season.
